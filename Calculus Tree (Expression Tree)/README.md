# calculus-tree
1-the expression tree is in binray_calculus_tree directory 

2-the other file was an attempt to build an expresssion tree using a general tree.
turns out the expression tree must be binray even in the general tree file
after examining it builds a binary tree at the end but less efficient and more complicated one. :)
