# ML_Math_Foundations
This repo represents my journey of stepping into machine learning, this repo will include 2 python files one for vectors algebra and another for probability & statistics (later in the future) (Feel free to use any code :) ) 
Update :
Since python is an essintial porgramming languages in machine learning there is a folder called python_projects in which I will upload my projects have a look at it :)
---update:
-2nd term in college started so i'm very busy at the moment so sorry for not upadating the repo for so long.
-for performance and as a dinasaur I will update the project to be a matrix library written in c++ so the vec.py is over by now and i will keep my word and 
make the fully functional matrix library. 
---huge update :
I've built a big chunk of the vectors algebra file and the source file with its header file are now availabe at vector algebra folder
note :in the header you can see functions that are built and tested its shown after the declaration itself feel free to use any code :)
