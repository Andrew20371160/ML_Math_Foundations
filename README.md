# ML_Math_Foundations
This repo represents my journey of stepping into machine learning, this repo will include 2 files one for matrix algebra and another for probability & statistics (later in the future) (Feel free to use any code :) ) 
-the matrix algebra c++ file has 38 matrix operations from simple addition and assignment till inverse and lu factorization and row reduced echolon form feel free to use it the way you want 
they are all tested if there are any bugs please let me know 
feel free to use any code :)
-update:I've updated some core functions like gauss_down or previously called utri to work in both types of matrices aka the ones that have pivots on the main diagonal and the ones that have the pivots on any col and the rank is updated to calculate rank for all types of matrices 
previously i thought it was only for square matrices but i was wrong
