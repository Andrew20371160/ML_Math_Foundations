# ML_Math_Foundations
This repo represents my journey of stepping into machine learning, this repo will include 2 python files one for vectors algebra and another for probability & statistics (later in the future) (Feel free to use any code :) ) 
-the vectors algebra c++ file has 36 matrix operations from simple addition and assignment till inverse and lu factorization feel free to use it the way you want 
they are all tested if there are any bugs please let me know 
feel free to use any code :)
